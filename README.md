# trypglyco
Models of Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma cruzi's glycolysis based on the work by B. Bakker and J. Haanstra, using Metabolic Control Analysis to model metabolic flux throught the pathway.

These models were written in Matlab/Octave during 2007-2009. The purpose of this repository is to refactor the code and write it in Python, probably using Cobra or ScrumPy, and then apply machine learning techniques to the results and try to infer biologically relevant insights. The initial files uploaded are in the repository for the sake of documentation, but they won't be mantianed in the future.
